Project 2
CS4760
10/8/2020

So I ran out of time figuring things out, and the project doesn't work as it should.

That being said, what it does do is this:

-takes command line arguments and data file
-creates and attaches shared memory
-copies file data to shared memory
-client program is exec'd and reads shared memory.

Palindromes can check for palindromes, however this functionality is not being used
because of my issues with shared memory.

make with make

invocation is ./master -n <int> -t <int> -s <int> filename
-h gives usage.

I ran out of time, and started too late. I'll do better next time.
Qapla!
